    "To identify the best-performing model, I am comparing the accuracy scores of each model. Accuracy is a common and intuitive metric to assess how well the models classify activities correctly in a multiclass classification problem. Moreover, Accuracy is a good choice here because it provides an overall measure of how well the models are performing in classifying the activities. It's easy to understand and interpret. \n",

    "\n",
    "- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 0.9802\n",

    "- Linear Kernel SVM Accuracy: 0.9786\n",
    "\n",
    "- RBF Kernel SVM Accuracy: 0.9744\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Tree Accuracy: 0.9262\n",
    "\n",
    "The Logistic Regression model, which has an accuracy of 0.9803, is the top-performing model out of those put to the test. For all activity classes (1-6), this model has high precision, recall, and F1-scores and has only a few instances of misclassifications, as seen in the confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "With an accuracy of 0.9786, which is very close to the Logistic Regression model, the Linear Kernel SVM is the second-best performing model. Additionally, it gives minimum misclassifications, good recall, precision, and F1-scores for all classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "With an accuracy of 0.9744, the RBF Kernel SVM performs well, but it has a few more misclassifications than the linear models. For all courses, it still offers good precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison to the other models, the Decision Tree model exhibits more misclassifications and has a good accuracy of 0.9262, but it also has slightly lower precision, recall, and F1-scores for various classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, based on the available data and features, the Logistic Regression model seems to be the best option for this classification problem. It is a reliable option for predicting human activities from sensor data since it obtains the best accuracy and upholds high precision and recall for all classes."
